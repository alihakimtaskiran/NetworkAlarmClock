# NetworkAlarmClock
Do you believe that only luxury is time? As time elapses, we may not aware it.
Therefore we need a bell which rings each 15 minutes. This is a network based alarm. It includes a speaker and esp866. It works only network available. Modify the code for your wifi credentials then use it.
