# NetworkAlarmClock
Do you believe that only luxury is time? As time elapses, we may not aware it.
Therefore we need a bell which rings each 15 minutes. This is a network based alarm. It includes a speaker and esp866. It works only network available. Modify the code for your wifi credentials,UTC value then use it.
It rings at 8.30 a.m. and rings each 15 minutes until 11.45 p.m.
